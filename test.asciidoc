== Events

Beans may produce and consume events. This facility allows beans to interact in a completely decoupled fashion, with no compile-time dependency between the interacting beans. Most importantly, it allows stateful beans in one architectural tier of the application to synchronize their internal state with state changes that occur in a different tier.

An event comprises:

* A Java object - the _event object_
* A set of instances of qualifier types - the _event qualifiers_
